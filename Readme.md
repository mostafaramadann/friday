### API
To run the API, fill out the .env file with an openai key, hugging face key (if using hugging face models), and a serpapi key (if using search with the chatbot)

Really only the OpenAI key is needed, you can remove the other stuff

Also run
`pip install reqs.txt`
### Client
To run the client you will need yarn. Install the dependencies with
`yarn add`

Then run
`yarn dev`
